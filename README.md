# MachineLearningLab
Implementing supervised & unsupervised machine learnig models with different metrics
## TP3 Supervised Learning
* Difference between cross validation and train test split methods
* Comparaison between different models (decision tree,randon forest,Naive Bayes,KNN...) with different methods 
  * crossvalidation with different K values
  * traintestsplit with different test percentage 
 
 ## TP4 Unsupervised Learning
 * clusteringmethods
    * K-means
    * CAH ascendant way
    * Divisive clustering descendant way
